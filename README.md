## History & motivation 

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, I started gathering YouTube Channels specialized in this content and I was impressed with how there was so much more than I ever thought. Videos of people walking on cities around the world, climbing mountains, relaxing at beaches, cycling - there are all kinds of flavors. 

I do have my favorites one, which makes me feel better, alliviates anxiety, and bring new images and sounds to my boring, confined reality. I also found out several other people felt the same, finding similar ways of escapism. But there wasn't a very good app for that, you have to find these videos for yourself which can be itself an stressful task.

So I started talking with some friends, and along with one of them we started sketching ideas for a website to showcase all the great videos we found. We'd like to help popularize Slow TV, as well as help all the quarantined people around the world so they feel better about being stuck at home.

## What is Slow TV?

"Television at the speed of life.
Longform videos meant to be played for ambience: crackling fireplaces, train rides, sandy beaches, shots of the earth from space and knitting. >Slow TV, is a term used for a genre of "marathon" TV coverage of an ordinary event in its complete length. It was popularized in the 2000s by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), beginning with the broadcast of a 7-hour train journey in 2009."
